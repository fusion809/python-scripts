= Python
*Python* is a high-level, general-purpose, cross-platform interpreted language that is widely used for a variety of different purposes, including:

* *Package management* -- DNF, Entropy, Portage and yum are all examples of Linux package managers written in Python.
* *Scientific computing*, especially numerical analysis, but also symbolic calculations. SageMath is the most notable example of mathematics software that is written in Python.
* *Web development*. Python powers several different Wiki applications (including MoinMoin, which is used by the Debian and Ubuntu Wikis), along with Google
* *Writing games*
