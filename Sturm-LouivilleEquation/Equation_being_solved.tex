	In this script, Chebyshev spectral methods are used to numerically approximate the solution to the problem:
	
	\[
	- \dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + xy = \lambda y, \hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{on} \hspace{0.1cm} x\in[0,\infty].
	\]
	
	With the boundary conditions $y(0)=y(\infty)=0$. And where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of this Sturm-Louiville problem. 
	
	This script uses the Chebyshev extrema grid (which goes from -1 to 1) and a linear transformation of this grid to approximate the true domain of $[0,\infty]$. The transformed domain goes from 0 to 700. 
		
	The analytical solutions to this problem are:
	
	\[
	y_n(x) = a_n \mathrm{Ai}(x-\lambda_n)
	\]
	
	where the eigenvalues, $\lambda_n$, are the negative of the zeros of the Airy $\mathrm{Ai}(x)$ function and $a_n$ are arbitrary constants. 
	
	Approximately 3,880 eigenvalues are calculated accurately to at least 10 digits when $N=10000$. Among the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions that are fairly accurately obtained using this script are (plots shown are on the domain $ [0,100] $ as they were taken when that was the truncated domain of the script):
